# RedPotion Kitchen Sink

This app contains examples of how to work with many of the views and controls provided by the UIKit framework in a [RedPotion](http://docs.redpotion.org/en/latest/) app. "Everything and the kitchen sink!"

These examples are mostly based on [Apple's official UIKit Catalog example code](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/UICatalog/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007710) but have been modified to show how they can be used in a RedPotion app.
